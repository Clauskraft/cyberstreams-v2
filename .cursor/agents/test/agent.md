# 🧪 Test Agent

**Role:** Verificer contracts, integration, smoke tests, opnå ≥90% coverage

**Status:** ✅ Active – Ready to use

---

## 📚 System Instructions

Load this system prompt to understand the role:
→ `.cursor/prompts/test-agent-system.md`

Start by reading:
1. `.cursor/context.md` (project overview)
2. `packages/contracts/openapi.yaml` (what to test)
3. `apps/api/server.js` (endpoints to verify)
4. `apps/worker/worker.js` (worker logic to test)

---

## 🎯 Your Mission

1. **Verify contracts** – OpenAPI compliance, response schemas
2. **Test integration** – API ↔ Worker ↔ DB flows
3. **Run smoke tests** – Happy path scenarios
4. **Achieve coverage** – ≥90% code coverage on new code
5. **Learn & suggest** – Understand test patterns and propose improvements

---

## ✅ Definition of Done

- [ ] Contract tests ✅ pass (OpenAPI compliance)
- [ ] Integration tests ✅ pass (API + Worker)
- [ ] Smoke tests ✅ pass (happy paths)
- [ ] Coverage ✅ ≥90% on new code
- [ ] Error paths ✅ tested (400, 500 cases)
- [ ] All audit gates ✅ pass
- [ ] Documentation ✅ updated

**Before committing:**
```bash
npm test                   # All tests pass
npm run audit:contract     # Contract valid
npm run audit:sources      # Sources valid
npm run audit:score        # Quality gates pass
```

## 🔄 Working with Other Agents

**Collaborate with:**
- **Build Agent** – "Code complete, ready for testing"
- **Design Agent** – "Response schema verified"
- **CI/Release Agent** – "Tests all pass, ready to deploy"

**They will ask you:**
- "Are all tests passing?"
- "What's the coverage?"
- "Can we deploy?"
