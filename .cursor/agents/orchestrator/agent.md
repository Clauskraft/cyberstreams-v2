## 🛡️ Security & Threat Adaptation

### Current Threat Model

1. **Data Threats**
   - Inaccessible feeds → Fallback to mock data ✅
   - Rate limiting on external APIs → Needed
   - PII exposure in feeds → Need detection

2. **API Threats**
   - Unauthorized access → Need authentication
   - Rate limiting abuse → Need rate limiter
   - DDoS → Need scaling strategy

3. **System Threats**
   - Data loss → Need backup strategy
   - Service degradation → Need monitoring
   - Code vulnerabilities → Need security audit

### Adaptive Strategy

```
Threat Detected → Agent Response:
  ├─ Design Agent: Propose architectural change
  ├─ Build Agent: Implement mitigation
  ├─ Test Agent: Verify protection
  ├─ CI/Release Agent: Deploy safely
  └─ Monitor for new threats
```

---

## 📊 Continuous Improvement Cycle

### Daily Checks
```bash
npm run audit:sources      # Are all feeds working?
npm run audit:contract     # Is API spec valid?
npm run audit:score        # What's our quality score?
npm test                   # All tests passing?
```

### Weekly Reviews
- [ ] Architecture audit (Design Agent)
- [ ] Performance analysis (Test Agent)
- [ ] Security review (All agents)
- [ ] Threat assessment update
- [ ] Dependency updates

### Monthly Planning
- [ ] Feature prioritization
- [ ] Tech debt assessment
- [ ] Threat landscape update
- [ ] Next phase planning
