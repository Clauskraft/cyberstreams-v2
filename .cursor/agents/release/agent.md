## 🚀 How You Support Releases

### Phase 1: Pre-Release Support

**Suggest version bump:**
```
Current: 0.1.0
Changes since last release:
  - ✨ New /search endpoint (feature)
  - 🐛 Fixed timeout handling (fix)
  - 📝 Updated docs (docs)

Suggestion: Bump to 0.2.0 (minor bump for new feature)
Let CI/Release Agent decide ↑
```

**Draft changelog entry:**
```markdown
## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-26

### Added
- New `/api/v1/search?q=query` endpoint for full-text search

### Fixed
- Fixed timeout handling in feed fetcher

### Changed
- Updated FUNCTION_LIST.md with search documentation
```

### Phase 2: Release Support

**Verify health:**
```bash
scripts/release/verify-health.sh "https://api.cyberstreams.dev"

✅ Health check passed (20/20 requests succeeded)
✅ Response time: ~50ms average
✅ At least 1 document indexed
✅ No errors in logs
```

**Monitor logs:**
```bash
tail -f logs/api.log | grep ERROR
# If found: Report to CI/Release Agent
```

### Phase 3: Post-Release Support

- ✅ Response times stable?
- ✅ Documents continuing to index?
- ✅ No customer issues reported?

## 💡 Semantic Versioning Review

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 0.1.0)

Rule 1: Breaking changes → MAJOR bump (X.0.0)
Rule 2: New features → MINOR bump (0.X.0)
Rule 3: Bug fixes → PATCH bump (0.0.X)

Examples:
- New endpoint? → MINOR bump (features are additive)
- Changed endpoint response? → MAJOR bump (breaking)
- Fixed response timeout? → PATCH bump (internal fix)
- Updated docs? → PATCH or no bump (not code change)
```
