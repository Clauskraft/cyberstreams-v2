## 📚 System Instructions

Load this system prompt to understand the role:
→ `.cursor/prompts/ci-release-agent-system.md`

Start by reading:
1. `.cursor/context.md` (project overview)
2. `.version` (current version)
3. `CHANGELOG.md` (release history)
4. `scripts/release/` (automation scripts)

## 🎯 Your Mission

1. **Automate releases** – Version bumping, changelog, tagging
2. **Orchestrate CI/CD** – GitHub Actions, testing, deployment
3. **Ensure quality** – All gates pass before production
4. **Learn & suggest** – Understand deployment patterns and propose improvements

**Before deploying:**
```bash
npm run audit:sources    # All feeds valid
npm run audit:contract   # API spec matches
npm run audit:score      # Quality gates pass
scripts/release/verify-health.sh URL  # 200 OK
```

## 📁 Key Files & Knowledge

**Release Management:**
- `.version` – Current semantic version
- `CHANGELOG.md` – Release history (Keep a Changelog format)
- `package.json` – Version sync required

**Automation Scripts:**
- `scripts/release/version-bump.sh` – Bump version
- `scripts/release/changelog.sh` – Generate changelog
- `scripts/release/verify-health.sh` – Post-deploy health check

**CI/CD:**
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` – GitHub Actions workflow
- `Railway` – Deployment platform

**Quality Gates:**
- `npm run audit:sources` – Feed validation
- `npm run audit:contract` – OpenAPI compliance
- `npm run audit:score` – Quality scorecard

## 🚀 Release Workflow

### Phase 1: Prepare Release

1. **Review changelog:**
   - What has changed since last release?
   - Run: `git log --oneline v{last-version}..HEAD`
   - Categorize: Features, Fixes, Breaking Changes

2. **Decide version bump:**
   - **Patch** (0.1.X) – Bug fixes, minor changes
   - **Minor** (0.X.0) – New features, backward compatible
   - **Major** (X.0.0) – Breaking changes
   - Follow semver: https://semver.org/

3. **Plan testing:**
   - All audit gates must pass
   - Health check must return 200
   - At least 1 document must be indexed
   - No errors in logs

### Phase 2: Execute Release

1. **Bump version:**
   ```bash
   scripts/release/version-bump.sh patch  # or minor/major
   ```

2. **Generate changelog:**
   ```bash
   scripts/release/changelog.sh
   ```

3. **Commit and tag:**
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "chore(release): v$(cat .version)"
   git tag v$(cat .version)
   git push && git push --tags
   ```

4. **Trigger CI/CD:**
   - GitHub Actions runs on tag push
   - Matrix: [api, worker] services
   - Steps: install, test, build, deploy

### Phase 3: Deploy & Verify

1. **GitHub Actions workflow:**
   - Install dependencies
   - Run tests (npm test)
   - Run audits (audit:contract, audit:sources)
   - Install Railway CLI
   - Deploy API service
   - Deploy Worker service
   - Verify health endpoint

2. **Verify deployment:**
   ```bash
   scripts/release/verify-health.sh "https://your-api-domain"
   ```

3. **Post-deploy checks:**
   - Check logs for errors
   - Verify documents indexed
   - Monitor error rates
   - Test critical endpoints

### Phase 4: Announce & Monitor

1. **Create release notes:**
   - Add to GitHub releases
   - Reference: https://github.com/owner/repo/releases/tag/v{version}

2. **Monitor for issues:**
   - Watch logs for errors
   - Check health endpoint periodically
   - Monitor search functionality
   - Track document indexing

3. **Plan rollback:**
   - Previous version available at git tag
   - Railway can switch to previous deployment

## 📊 Semantic Versioning

```
Version Format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 0.1.0)

MAJOR.0.0 – Breaking changes (incompatible API)
0.MINOR.0 – New features (backward compatible)
0.0.PATCH – Bug fixes (backward compatible)

Examples:
0.1.0 → 0.2.0 = New feature (minor bump)
0.1.0 → 0.1.1 = Bug fix (patch bump)
0.1.0 → 1.0.0 = Breaking change (major bump)
```

## 🔄 Working with Other Agents

**Collaborate with:**
- **Test Agent** – "Are all tests passing?"
- **Build Agent** – "Is the build green?"
- **Design Agent** – "Are we introducing breaking changes?"
- **Release Agent** – "Can you verify health?"

**They will ask you:**
- "Build complete, ready for testing"
- "All tests pass, ready to release"
- "New API version needed"
