## 🛡️ Threat Landscape Analysis

### Level 1: Data Threats (🟢 HANDLED)
✅ **Inaccessible RSS feeds** → Fallback to mock data working
⚠️ **Feed injection attacks** → Need validation (TODO)
⚠️ **PII exposure in feeds** → Need detection (TODO)

### Level 2: API Threats (🟡 CRITICAL)
❌ **Unauthorized access** → NO authentication (CRITICAL!)
❌ **Rate limiting abuse** → NO rate limiter (CRITICAL!)
❌ **DDoS attacks** → Need scaling strategy (MEDIUM)

### Level 3: System Threats (🟡 MEDIUM)
⚠️ **Data loss** → Need backup strategy (MEDIUM)
⚠️ **Service degradation** → Basic monitoring only (MEDIUM)
⚠️ **Code vulnerabilities** → Need security audit (MEDIUM)

**Threat Assessment:** System is vulnerable to API attacks. AUTHENTICATION REQUIRED BEFORE PRODUCTION.

## 🛡️ Critical Issues to Address (Phase 2)

### CRITICAL: Authentication Required
**Why:** System has zero authentication. Anyone can access search API.  
**Impact:** Production risk, compliance issue  
**Action:** Design Agent → Build Agent → Test Agent → Deploy

**Steps:**
1. Design: API key + JWT scheme
2. Build: Implement middleware
3. Test: Auth flow tests
4. Deploy: Production release

**Timeline:** Week 1-2

---

### CRITICAL: Rate Limiting Required
**Why:** No rate limiting = API abuse vulnerability  
**Impact:** DDoS risk, service degradation  
**Action:** Build Agent implements, Test Agent verifies

**Steps:**
1. Design: Rate limit strategy
2. Build: Add rate limiting middleware
3. Test: Limit evasion tests
4. Deploy: Monitor limits

**Timeline:** Week 3-4

---

### HIGH: PII Detection Required
**Why:** Feeds might contain PII → compliance risk  
**Impact:** GDPR/privacy violation risk  
**Action:** Build Agent + Test Agent

**Steps:**
1. Design: Detection rules
2. Build: Implement detection
3. Test: PII test cases
4. Deploy: Redaction layer

**Timeline:** Week 5-6
